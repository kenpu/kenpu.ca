    > I have been asked to provide reference letters for job applications and
    > graduate studies.  Please be advised of the following:
    >
    > - Part of your request should include why you think I should be able to
    > adequately reflect your qualities as a candidate.  Remind me your
    > achievements and accomplishments that I can refer to.
    >
    > - Allow me at least *two* weeks to compose the letter.  This gives me
    > enough time to write a thoughtful letter to maximize the chance of
    > success.
