# Scala

- Java is a *simple* and *impure* object-oriented programming language.

- Scala

    - designed by _Martin Odersky_
    
    - first released in 2004
    
    - a *pure* object-oriented programming language

    - high degree of complexity

# Object-oriented programming (OOP)

>> All types are classes.

>> All data are objects.

>> All computation are method invocations.

# Java as an OOP

Type as class:

```java
class String {
    String substring(int start, int end) { ... }
}
```

Data as object:

```java
String message = "Hello world";
```

Computations as method invocations:

```java
System.out.println(message.substring(3, 6));
```
