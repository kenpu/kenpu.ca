# Course Outline

This course is divided into three parts.

1. Foundations of programming languages
2. Practical languages
3. Survey

<br>

## (I) Foundations

<br>

> [!](panel:info)
>
> # Computation
>
> - [Stateful computation](stateful-computation)
> - [Functional computation](functional-computation)
> - [Programming languages: at a glance](intro-to-languages)

<br>

> [!](panel:info)
> # Design of programming languages
> 
> - Organization and semantics
> - Type system

<br>

> [!](panel:info)
> # Functional programming
> 
> - Introduction to Clojure
> - Programming without mutable data

<br>

> [!](panel:info)
>
> # Programming Paradigms
>
> - Procedural programming
> - Object-oriented programming
> - Pure functional programming
> - Programming in reality

<br>

## (II) Practical languages

<br>

> [!](panel:info)
> # Scala
>
> - Pure object orientation in Scala
> - Strong type system
> - Functional programming in Scala

<br>

## (III) Survey

<br>

> [!](panel:info)
>
> - More languages (e.g. Haskell, Javascript/Typescript, Go)
> - More paradigms (e.g. Logical programming with Prolog)
