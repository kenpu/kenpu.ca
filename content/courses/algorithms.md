# Course description

We follow the bottom-up approach to algorithm design.  Starting with the
correctness and performance analysis of simple algorithms, we will progressively
study more sophisticated data structures and algorithms.

Students will gain working knowledge of algorithms and data structures.  We will
be using the Python programming language.

# Course Outline
