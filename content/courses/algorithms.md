> This course is about problem solving and computation via algorithms.
> We will cover a number of known algorithms (sorting, hashing, search,
> indexing) and their applications.  We will discuss methods for analyzing
> existing algorithms and designing new algorithms.
> Finally, the students will be introduced to *complexity classes*, in
> particular the class of *NP-completeness*.
