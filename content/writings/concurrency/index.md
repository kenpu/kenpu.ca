# Elements of Computation

- CPU as a function.

- Memory as persistent state.

- Programming languages are designed to communicate:

    1. **Types**: Format and interpretation of memory content.

    2. **Expressions**: Description of computations to be carried out.


[!](box) Today, we will examine the *expressions* that support concurrent
programming.

# Programming paradigm

- Imperative programming:

    > A programming paradigm that makes the distinction
    > between _statements_ and _expressions_.  Statements modify the state of
    > its runtime environment, while expressions use certain existing values to
    > evaluate another value.

- Functional programming:

    > A programming paradigm that forbiddens modification of existing values.
    > All values are created once, and remain read-only.  Functions and data are
    > unified, known as _functions as data_.  State of the runtime is modeled
    > not by data (in the sense of imperative programming), but rather one or
    > more functions.

[!](&&&)

Modern languages are designed with features supporting both paradigms.

[!](note) But what about _Object-oriented_ programming paradigm?



# Concurrency

First of all, _concurrency is not parallism_.
[1](https://talks.golang.org/2012/waza.slide#1)

What's the distinction?

1. Concurrency is about the _programming_ constructs that allow _programmers_ to
compose multiple interdependent (but non-sequential) units of computation.

2. Parallelism is about _executing_ units of computation using multiple
interdependent processors.

---

[!](columns 6:)

_Parallelism_

- Multi-core
- Cluster
- The Internet

[!](split)

_Concurrency_

- Code constructs (threads, goroutines, channels, futures, promises, async,
  scatter-gather, ...)
- Even single-core, one-process program can be _concurrent_

# Concurrency $\supset$ Parallelism

- Concurrency is about *programming*.

- Concurrency is about a way to _think_.

- Concurrent programming is to adapt to the ever increasing parallel runtime
  environments.

# Concurrent programming


- Concurrent programming is not an extention of imperative programming.

- Java's threading model is fundamentally prohibitive from a programmer's
  perspective.


# Computation & Composition

*Composition*

```
let x = f(...)
let y = g(x)
let z = h(y)
```

Or simply:

```
let z = h(g(f(...)))
```

[!](***)

No concurrency.

# ________________________


*Independent computation*

[!](columns 6:)

```
let x = f(...)
let y = g(...)
let z = h(...)
```

[!](split)

We can evaluate `f, g` and `h` on separate processors.

```scala
spawn { x = f(...) }
spawn { y = g(...) }
spawn { z = h(...) }
```


# _________________________

*Partial composition*

[!](columns 6:)

```rust
let x = f(...)
let y = g(...)
let z = h(x, y)
```

[!](split)

We can evaluate `f` and `g` on separate processors, and use the results to
evaluate `h`.

```scala
x = result of spawn { f(...) }
y = result of spawn { g(...) }

wait-for-all(x, y) as (x, y) {
    z = h(x, y)
}
```

# ____________________________

*Partial composition*

[!](columns 6:)

```
let x = f(...)
let y = g(...)
let z = x or y
```

[!](split)

```scala
x = result of spawn { f(...) }
y = result of spawn { g(...) }

wait-for-any(x, y) as (u) {
    z = u
}
```


# ________________________

*Transaction*

[!](columns 6:)

- Functions may _fail_ to complete, and result in error.

- Transaction:

    ```scala
    snapshot()
    h(g(f(...)))

    if error:
      reverse back to snapshot()
    ```

[!](split)

```scala
transaction {
    f()
    g()
    h()
}
```

# _______________________

*Data exchange*

- Long running functions that require data from one another mutually
  recursively.

[!](***)

```nosyntax
F() {
  get x from G
  send x' back to G
  ...
}

G() {
  send x to F
  get x' from F
  ...
}

spawn F()
spawn G()
```

[!](note) We can have multi-way data exchange among multiple long running
functions.

# Let's get *practical* âœŒ

> 2) Clojure

# Go: independent computation

[!](columns 6:)

```{go sm clipboard}
func is_prime(n int64) bool {
    for(i := 2; i < n; i++) {
        if n % i == 0 {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
}
```

Compute the 1000th prime number.

[!](split)

```{go sm clipboard}
func is_perfect(n int64) bool {
    var total int64 = 0
    for i := int64(1); i < n; i++ {
        if n % i == 0 {
            total += i
        }
    }
    return total == n
}
```

Compute the 4th perfect number.

# __________________________

```{go sm clipboard}
func nth_prime(nth int) int64 {
    found := 0
    var n int64
    for n = 2; found < nth; i++ {
        if is_prime(n) {
            found += 1
        }
    }

    if found == nth {
        prime_1000 = n
    }
}

ans1 := nth_prime(1000)
```

Let's do some refactoring so we can reuse the code for the 4th perfect number.

# ______________

```{go sm clipboard}
func look_for(predicate func(int64) bool, nth int) {
    found := 0
    var n int64
    for n = 2; found < nth; i++ {
        if predicate(n) {
            found += 1
        }
    }
    if found == nth {
        return n
    } else {
        return 0
    }
}
```

# __________________

```{go sm}
var prime_1000 int
var perfect_4 int

go func() {
    prime_1000 = look_for(is_prime, 1000)
}()

go func() {
    perfect_4 = look_for(is_perfect, 4)
}()
```

# Clojure: Independent computation

```{clojure sm}
(defn prime? [n]
  (every? #(not (zero? (mod n %1))) (range 2 n)))
```

```{clojure sm}
(defn perfect? [n]
  (let [factors (filter #(zero? (mod n %)) (range 1 n))]
    (reduce + 0 factors)))
```

```{clojure sm}
(defn look-for [pred n]
  (nth (filter pred (iterate inc 2)) n))
```

# _______________________

```{clojure sm}
(def prime-1000 (future (look-for prime? 1000)))

(def perfect-4  (future (look-for perfect? 4)))
```
[!](note)
`(future ...)` evaluates the expression in the background.  When it's complete,
the result is saved in the _reference_.

# Partial composition

*Problem to solve*:

Find the sum of the 1000-th prime and the 4th perfect number.

*Solutions*:

1. Goroutine & channels

2. Clojure futures and deref of futures


# Goroutine and channels

- We have already seen goroutines:

```{go sm}
go f(...)
```

- Channels are native type in Go.  You can send *anything* over a channel.

```{go sm}
var ch = make(chan int)
```
[!](note) Create a bi-directional channel for exchanging integers.

```{go sm}
var i int = <- ch
```
[!](note) Read an integer from the channel.  If nothing is in the channel, this
will block.

```{go sm}
ch <- 42
```
[!](note) Writes an integer into the channel.


# ______________________________

```{go sm nu}
func computation() int64 {
    var ch chan int64 = make(chan int64)

    go func() {
        p := look_for(is_prime, 1000)
        ch <- p
    }()

    go func() {
        q := look_for(is_perfect, 4)
        ch <- q
    }()

    result := (<-ch) + (<-ch)
    return result
}
```
[!](note) Line 14. blocks until both prime/perfect numbers are computed.

# Clojure's solution

```{clojure sm}
(def prime-1000 (future (look-for prime? 1000)))
(def perfect-4  (future (look-for perfect? 4)))
(println (+ (deref prime-1000) (deref perfect-4)))
```
[!](note)
`deref` blocks until the result of the `future`s are available, and returns the
result.

---

Here is a more functional style:

```{clojure sm}
(let [a (future (look-for prime? 1000))
      b (future (look-for perfect? 4))
      result (+ @a @b)]
  (println result))
```

# Partial composition

Now, let's consider a different problem:

> Compute either the 1000th prime, or the 4th perfect number.

The strategy is to concurrently evaluate both computations, and as soon as one
is done, return it.


# Go's channel selection

```{go sm}
select {
case v1 = <- ch1:
    ...
case v2 = <- ch2:
    ...
}
```

[!](note)
This tries to read from `ch1` or `ch2`, and it guarantees to read only at most one of
them.  If both channels are empty, then `default` case is evaluated.


# Go's solution using `select`

```{go sm}
func async_look_for(cond func(int64) bool, nth int) chan int64 {
    ch := make(chan int64)
    go func() {
        ch<- look_for(cond, nth)
    }()
    return ch
}
```
[!](note 3) Pretty cool.  Instead of returning the result, we wrap the result in a
channel.

```{go sm}
func computation() int64 {
    result1 := async_look_for(is_prime, 1000)
    result2 := async_look_for(is_perfect, 4)

    var answer int64
    select {
    case answer = <-result1:
    case answer = <-result2:
    }
    return answer
}
```
[!](note 3) The `select { ... }` will block until the first prime/perfect number
is computed.

# Go's solution using pure channel operations

```{go sm}
func async_look_for(cond func(int64) bool, nth int, results chan int64) {
    ch := make(chan int64)
    go func() {
        results<- look_for(cond, nth)
    }()
}
```

```{go sm}
func computation() {
    results = chan int64

    async_look_for(is_prime, 1000, results)
    async_look_for(is_perfect, 4, results)

    answer := <-results
    close(results)
    return answer
}
```

[!](note) We pass a channel into `async_look_for` to collect their results of
computation.  As soon as one result appears in the channel, we are done.

# Conclusion for Go:

- Channels + Goroutines = Really powerful and universal solution

- This is called the _Communicating Sequential Processes_ (CSP)


# Clojure's CSP

`(require '[clojure.core.async :as async :refer :all])`

```{clojure sm}
(go ...)
```
[!](note) Starts a go-routine.

```{clojure sm}
(chan)
```
[!](note) Constructs a bi-directional channel.

```{clojure sm}
(<! ch)
```
[!](note) Read one value from the channel.  It blocks in the go-routine.

```{clojure sm}
(>! ch x)
```
[!](note) Writes one value into the channel.

```{clojure sm}
(close! ch)
```
[!](note) Closes the channel.


# Clojure's solution - using alt!


```clojure
(let [[val ch] (alt! [ch1 ch2 ...])]
    ...)
```
[!](note) `alt!` blocks until one of the channels receives some value.
Returns the value and the channel it comes from.

There are two version:

- `alt!` is used in a go-routine.
- `alt!!` is used in the context of an actual thread.


# ___________________

```clojure
(defn async-look-for [pred n]
  (let [ch (chan)]
    (go (>! ch (look-for pred n)))
    ch))
```

```clojure
(defn computation []
  (let [ch1 (async-look-for prime? 1000)
        ch2 (async-look-for perfect? 4)]
    (let [ans ch] (alt!! [ch1 ch2])
      ans)))
```

# Clojure's solution - using pure channel operations

```clojure
(defn async-look-for [pred n results]
  (go (>! results (look-for pred n))))
```

```clojure
(defn computation []
  (let [ch (chan)]
    (future
      (do (async-look-for prime? 1000 ch)
          (async-look-for perfect? 4 ch)))
    (let [ans (<!! ch)]
      (close! ch)
      ans)))
```

# Conclusion

- Clojure already had a rich set of concurrency constructs (2007-2015).

- CSP is so successful as a model to express concurrency compositions that
  Clojure added support for CSP, and it is the preferred way.


# Scaling to multiple machines

Let's revisit CSP:

- Go routines

- Channels

----

We just need to implement go-routines and channels over the network.

- go-routines = processes

- channels = message queues

# Introducing RabbitMQ

<img src="rabbitmq.jpg"></img>

[!](note) Provides queueing service as a standalone server, or a server cluster.

# Message queues are channels between machines

<img src="rmq-example.png"></img>

# Discovering primes

```clojure
(defn feed []
  (let [server (connect connection-info)
        ch (open server)
        queue "input-queue"]
    (doseq [i (iterate inc 0)]
      (publish ch queue i))))
```
[!](note) Places all numbers on the queue called _input-queue_.


# ___________________

```{clojure sm}
(def output
  (let [server (connect connection-info)
        ch (open server)
        queue "output-queue"]
    {:ch ch
     :queue queue}))
```
[!](note) Declare the queue that will gather the answers.

```{clojure sm}
(defn task []
  (let [server (connect connection-info)
        ch (open server)
        queue "input-queue"]
    (subscribe ch queue 
            (fn [i] (when (__prime__? i)
                      (publish output i))))))
```
>
> 1. Get a job, `i`.
> 2. Performs the computation `(prime? i)`.
> 3. If we get a prime, send it to the output queue.
>
> [!](note) 

```{clojure sm}
 (defn worker []
  (dotimes [i 32] (future (task))))
```
[!](note) start 32 concurrent sessions to do the tasks assuming we have 32 cores.

# _____________________

```bash
## Start the job feeder
nohup clojure feed.clj &

## start the remote workers
for m in $machines
do
    ssh $m nohup clojure worker.clj
done

## Subscribe to output queue, and save to database
nohup clojure result-to-db.clj
```

[!](note) `$machine` may have 100 AWS instances = $32\times 100 = 3,200$ cores.
