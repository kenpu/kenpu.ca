Your mobile phone knows more about what's going on than you realize, and
therefore, it should be able to make better recommendations that it's doing now.

In this project, we are building a new mobile based recommender system that can
safely and privately observe its environment, deduce the situational context,
and make more sensible recommendations to the user.
