If computers can [play Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo) brilliantly,
why can't we use our mobile phones to solve general puzzles?

The reason is that we don't have a great algebra (and an interface) to enable
user access to the powerful constraint solvers.  This project is to investigate
the design and feasibility of such constraint solving interfaces (either as an
application, or a special purpose programming language).
